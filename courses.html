				<h3>How My Courses Have Contributed to My Academic Growth</h3>
Each of my courses at the University of New Hampshire has contributed to my academic development by building key skills and knowledge in my dual fields of Entrepreneurship and Sustainability.

Wildlife Ecology taught me about the complex relationships between wildlife and their ecosystems, strengthening my understanding of conservation and sustainability.

In Management Information Systems, I learned how to use technology to improve decision-making and operational efficiency in businesses, particularly with a focus on data-driven solutions.

Business Ethics challenged me to think critically about the moral implications of business decisions, emphasizing the importance of ethical practices and corporate social responsibility.

Micro Economics helped me grasp how market forces shape decision-making, resource allocation, and the behavior of individuals and businesses.

The First Year Academic Experience equipped me with essential skills in time management, communication, and networking, which have been crucial in balancing academics and extracurriculars.

Together, these courses have sharpened my critical thinking, analytical abilities, and professional network, preparing me for success in my future career.
