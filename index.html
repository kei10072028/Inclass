				Hi there! My name is Kaitlyn Ilacqua, and I’m currently a student at the University of New Hampshire, where I am pursuing a dual major in Entrepreneurship and Sustainability. I grew up in the beautiful town of Franconia, NH, surrounded by the stunning White Mountains, which has deeply influenced my passion for the outdoors and my desire to make a positive impact on the world.

I’ve always believed that making a difference starts with a single step, whether that's through creative business solutions or sustainable practices that benefit both people and the planet. As someone who loves the idea of blending innovation with environmental responsibility, I’m excited about the opportunities ahead to change the world in a way that supports both economic growth and ecological health.

				When I'm not studying, you can usually find me outdoors, whether I'm hiking up a mountain, skiing down a trail, swimming in a lake, or mountain biking through the woods. I’m incredibly passionate about adventure and love sharing those experiences with others.

Alongside my academic pursuits, I’m fortunate to work in several roles that allow me to combine my love for the outdoors with my career goals. I serve as the Adventure Recreation Director for the Town of Franconia, where I help create outdoor programs and activities for the community. Additionally, I work as a Mountain Guide at the North Country Climbing Center, helping others explore the world of climbing. I also work as a lifeguard during triathlons, ensuring the safety of athletes and being part of their journey toward their goals.

My goal is to continue developing as both an entrepreneur and a sustainability advocate, using the skills I’ve gained to contribute to a better, more sustainable world. Thanks for visiting my page, and I’m excited to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for adventure and positive change!
